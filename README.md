# Hyper_Lethal_Unity

### Welcome to Hyper Lethal!
This is a rougelite game I've been intermittently working on over the course of my undergrad. I'm taking a little break from it to work on some projects that are more closely related to my interests  but I plan to come back to it eventually.

high-priority goals (advanced):
Create framework for player and enemy behavior
Enemies and weapons
Items behavior 
Some kind of gameplay

In the meantime (intermediate):
Audio, music, art

To be done later:
Level generation
