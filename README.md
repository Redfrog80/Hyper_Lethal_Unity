# Hyper_Lethal_Unity

### Welcome to Hyper Lethal!
This is a rougelite game I've been intermittently working on over the course of my undergrad. I'm taking a little break from it to work on some projects that are more closely related to my interests  but I plan to come back to it eventually. I did put this project up on the Aggie Coding Club to try to bring in people who can help me but the turnout wasn't great, nor were the people who were supposed to help me lead it.

high-priority goals (advanced):
Create framework for player and enemy behavior
Enemies and weapons
Items behavior 
Some kind of gameplay

In the meantime (intermediate):
Audio, music, art

To be done later:
Level generation
